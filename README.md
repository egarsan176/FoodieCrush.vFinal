# FoodieCrushFINAL

**_FoodieCrush_** is my final project of the **CFGS Web Application Development**.
This project consists of a recipe blog where we find the following roles:

- User: can only see the recipes published on the blog.
- Logged in user: can do the same as a user and can also publish their own recipes and consult them to edit or delete them.
- Administrator user: can do the same as a logged-in user and also manages the blog's recipes, as well as comments, ingredients and users.

Several _frameworks_ have been used for the development of this project, such as:

- **SpringBoot**
- **Angular**
- **Bootstrap5**
- **PrimeNG**

The programming language used was **JavaScript** _(TypeScript for Angular)_ on the front end and **Java** on the back end.
